# Privacy Policy

Steam Pattern & Float Checker does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.

The extension works locally in the browser and only reads publicly available item data on Steam pages in order to display float value and pattern index for CS2/CS:GO items.

No personal information, browsing history, or identifiable data is collected or shared with third parties.

If you have any questions, you can contact the developer via the GitHub repository.
